# 8Bitify
A python program to deconstruct any audio .wav file, then discretize the contents into an 8bit resolution.

The idea could potentially expand depending on results of development and experiments.

## dependancies
- numpy (operate on raw audio data via linear algebra etc.)
- snack (audio playback)

## potential dependancies
- pysox (deconstruct / reconstruct various audio file types)
- matplotlib (visualize experiments)
